# DissectML

**The missing middle layer between EDA and AutoML.**

DissectML (`dissectml` on PyPI) gives data scientists a single, unified pipeline from raw data to publication-ready insights — in as few as 3 function calls.

```python
import dissectml as iml

df = iml.load_titanic()
report = iml.analyze(df, target="survived")
report.export("report.html")
```

## Why DissectML?

| Without DissectML | With DissectML |
|---|---|
| YData Profiling + PyCaret + SHAP + matplotlib | One library |
| 30+ lines of boilerplate | 3 function calls |
| No cross-tool insights | Pipeline stages inform each other |
| Static outputs | Interactive Plotly charts |

## Key Features

- **Deep EDA** — unified correlation matrix, MCAR/MAR/MNAR missing analysis, auto clustering, interaction detection
- **Pre-model Intelligence** — 4-pronged leakage detection, VIF, data readiness score (0–100), algorithm recommendations
- **Model Battle** — parallel CV across 19 classifiers / 17 regressors with EDA-informed preprocessing
- **Comparative Analysis** — McNemar test, corrected paired t-test, Pareto front, cross-model error analysis
- **HTML Report** — self-contained interactive report with Plotly charts, collapsible sections, sidebar TOC
